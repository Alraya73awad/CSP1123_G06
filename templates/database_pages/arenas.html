    <h2>The Battlefield Matters</h2>
    <p>
        Arenas are not just scenery. Each arena has its own atmosphere and tactical feel,
        nudging certain weapon styles or defensive setups to shine. Learning the arenas
        helps you pick the right bot for the job.

    <h2>Ironclash Colosseum</h2>
    <p>
        A brutal pit where close combat thrives. Melee builds feel right at home here,
        while ranged kits can struggle to keep distance.

    <h2>Skyline Expanse</h2>
    <p>
        Open skies and long sightlines give ranged weapons a clear advantage. If you rely
        on blades or fists, plan to close the gap fast.

    <h2>Neutral Arena</h2>
    <p>
        No tricks, no bias. This is the proving ground where balanced builds and smart
        stat planning win the day.

    <h2>Frozen Wastes</h2>
    <p>
        Treacherous footing and biting winds slow the pace of combat. Durable bots and
        steady damage tend to outlast flashy bursts here.
