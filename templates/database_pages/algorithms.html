    <h2>What Algorithms Do</h2>
    <p>
        Algorithms are the AI cores that shape how your bot fights. Each algorithm applies
        fixed stat multipliers that are factored into combat and into the stat previews you
        see on the dashboard and manage screens. Pick one to define your bot's identity:
        raw damage, fortified defense, balanced stability, high speed, adaptive variance,
        or unpredictable chaos.
    </p>

    <h2>How Modifiers Are Applied</h2>
    <p>
        Algorithm effects are multiplicative buffs/nerfs on base stats. For example,
        PROC and DEF are scaled by the algorithm multiplier, then used in combat formulas.
        If an algorithm does not list a stat, that stat stays unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
        Weapon attack is added to base PROC, then the algorithm PROC multiplier is applied.
        This means aggressive algorithms amplify weapon damage more than defensive ones.

    <h2>Algorithm Catalog</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>VEX-01 - Aggressive</strong><br>
        Vexor Assault Kernel. +15% PROC, -10% DEF. Ideal for burst damage and fast takedowns,
        but fragile if fights drag on.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>BASL-09 - Defensive</strong><br>
        Bastion Logic Framework. +20% DEF, -10% CLK. A fortress AI that shrugs off hits but
        acts later and dodges less often.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>EQUA-12 - Balanced</strong><br>
        Equilibrium Core Matrix. No buffs or nerfs. Best for flexible builds or testing weapons
        without algorithm bias.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>ADAPT-X - Adaptive</strong><br>
        Adaptive Pattern Synthesizer. +5% ENT, -10% PROC. High-variance playstyle that leans into
        crits and rare effects at the cost of raw output.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>RUSH-09 - Speed</strong><br>
        Rapid Unit Synchronization Hub. +20% CLK, -10% DEF. Strikes first and dodges more, but
        can crumble under sustained pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>CHAOS-RND - Random</strong><br>
        Chaotic Execution Driver. No fixed stat multipliers. The build relies on standard
        combat randomness (crits, dodges, arena variance) to swing outcomes.

    <h2>XP Multipliers</h2>
    <p>
        Algorithms also affect how fast your bot levels in battle. Higher-risk cores earn more XP:
        VEX-01 (1.15x), BASL-09 (1.10x), EQUA-12 (1.00x), ADAPT-X (1.20x), RUSH-09 (1.10x),
        CHAOS-RND (1.30x).
