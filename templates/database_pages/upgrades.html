    <h2>Character Upgrades</h2>
    <p>
        Upgrades are consumable modules you can purchase on the Character page. They
        permanently enhance a single bot, so choose carefully based on the role you want
        that bot to fill.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="database-section">
    <h2>Armor Plating</h2>
    <p>
        Reinforces your frame with dense alloy layers. Great for defensive builds and
        any bot that is expected to take sustained damage.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="database-section">
    <h2>Overclock Unit</h2>
    <p>
        Pushes your clock speed beyond safe limits. The burst of speed is a big deal in
        turn order and evasion, but it is not free power. Pair it with a strong energy plan.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="database-section">
    <h2>Regen Core</h2>
    <p>
        A slow but steady repair routine that keeps your bot online longer. Best on
        endurance builds that want to survive long engagements.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="database-section">
    <h2>Critical Subroutine</h2>
    <p>
        A razor sharp targeting routine that increases your chance to land decisive hits.
        It pairs well with high Entropy and aggressive playstyles.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="database-section">
    <h2>Energy Recycler</h2>
    <p>
        Reclaims wasted power during combat. This is a flexible upgrade that helps almost
        any build stay active for longer fights.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="database-section">
    <h2>EMP Shield</h2>
    <p>
        Insulates your core from disruptive effects. If your bot relies on consistent
        ability usage, this can keep your strategy intact under pressure.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="database-section">
    <h2>Upgrade Tip</h2>
    <p>
        Focus your upgrades on a clear role instead of spreading them thin. A bot built
        to do one thing well is easier to pilot and easier to improve.
    </p>
