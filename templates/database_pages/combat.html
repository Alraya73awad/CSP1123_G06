    <h2>Battle Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Clash of Code battles are fast, tactical duels between two AI cores. Your bot's
        stats, algorithm, and weapon work together to decide who acts first, who lands
        the cleanest hits, and who runs out of power.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="database-section">
    <h2>Turn Flow</h2>
    <p>
        Each round, both bots get a chance to act. Higher Clock Rate (CLK) usually means
        acting first, which can be the difference between a clean knockout and a narrow loss.
        If both bots are equally fast, the order can shift from round to round.
    </p>

<section class="database-section">
    <h2>Energy and Endurance</h2>
    <p>
        Every action consumes energy. A bot with a strong Power Core (PWR) can stay active
        longer and keep pressure on the opponent, while low-energy builds risk stalling out
        before the fight is decided.
    </p>

<section class="database-section">
    <h2>Damage, Dodges, and Critical Hits</h2>
    <p>
        Damage scales with Processing Output (PROC) and is reduced by Defense (DEF).
        High Entropy (ENT) leans into risk: critical hits can swing a round, but they never
        replace good fundamentals like solid defense and speed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Faster bots are harder to pin down. If your CLK outpaces your opponent, you'll
        notice more clean hits and fewer returns.
    </p>

<section class="database-section">
    <h2>Signature Protocols</h2>
    <p>
        Some bots carry special protocols that can trigger under pressure. These are rare,
        dramatic moments that can change the pace of a fight. Treat them as bonuses, not
        guaranteed wins.

<section class="database-section">
    <h2>Arenas</h2>
    <p>
        The battlefield matters. Some arenas favor melee, some favor ranged, and others
        test pure stability. Check the Arenas page to see which environments best suit
        your build.

<section class="database-section">
    <h2>Combat Logs</h2>
    <p>
        After each battle, the combat log records the key events in order. It's the best
        way to understand how your build performs and where it needs tuning.
