    <h2>Why Weapons Matter</h2>
    <p>
        Weapons define how your bot delivers damage. Each weapon adds offensive power and
        sets the combat style: close-range pressure or long-range precision.
    </p>

<section class="database-section">
    <h2>Melee vs. Ranged</h2>
    <p>
        Melee weapons are built for direct impact and thrive in tight, aggressive fights.
        Ranged weapons trade raw pressure for flexibility and safer openings. Certain arenas
        subtly favor one style over the other.

<section class="database-section">
    <h2>Tiers and Progression</h2>
    <p>
        Weapons come in tiers, with higher tiers offering stronger base output. You can
        level weapons up over time, gradually improving their damage potential without
        changing your bot's core stats.
    </p>

<section class="database-section">
    <h2>Equipping Gear</h2>
    <p>
        A bot can only equip one weapon at a time. If you equip a new weapon, the previous
        one is automatically unequipped. Consider your algorithm and stat build before
        locking in your loadout.
