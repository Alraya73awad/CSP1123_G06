    <h2>What Your Rating Means</h2>
    <p>
        Rating represents your performance against other players. Win battles to climb,
        lose battles and your rating drops. Strong wins against tough opponents move you
        faster than stomping a lower-ranked rival.

<section class="database-section">
    <h2>Rank Tiers</h2>
    <p>
        Your rating places you into a tier. These tiers are more than titles, they hint
        at the kind of players and builds you'll face in ranked battles.
    </p>

                    {{ tier.min }}+

    <h2>Keeping It Fair</h2>
    <p>
        The system is designed to reward consistency over lucky streaks. A balanced
        win rate and steady improvement will outpace short bursts of success.
