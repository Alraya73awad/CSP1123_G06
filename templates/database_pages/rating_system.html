    <h2>What Your Rating Means</h2>
    <p>
        Rating represents your performance against other players. Win battles to climb,
        lose battles and your rating drops. Strong wins against tough opponents move you
        faster than stomping a lower-ranked rival.

<section class="database-section">
    <h2>Rank Tiers</h2>
    <p>
        Your rating places you into a tier. These tiers are more than titles, they hint
        at the kind of players and builds you'll face in ranked battles.

        win rate and steady improvement will outpace short bursts of success.
